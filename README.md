## Cafe Sales Report
By Ayuni Sevrilian - Sales analysis using SQL based on cafe transaction


---
## üìò About the Project

This project focuses on analyzing transactional sales data collected from a cafe using structured SQL queries.  
It demonstrates how SQL can be used not just for querying data but for performing comprehensive data analysis including aggregation, ranking, trend analysis, and categorization.  
By transforming raw sales data into actionable insights, this project aims to assist cafe management in making strategic decisions based on real-time sales patterns and historical performance.

## üìÇ Dataset
NOTE :
Before importing cafe sales data into SQL, all error values in the Excel file were replace with NULL to simpilify data type
recognition and ensure compatibility with SQL.

This dataset uses from Kaggle:  
[Cafe Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training)

## üéØ Purpose of the Project

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Conduct EDA using SQL queries.  
- Extract actionable business insights from sales data.  
- Visualize patterns related to sales, product performance, and customer behavior.  
- Improve strategic business decisions based on historical performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**: `ISNULL()`, `COALESCE()`, `CASE`, conditional logic  
- **Transformation & Calculation**: `NULLIF()`, arithmetic  
- **Aggregations & Windowing**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`  
- **Time Functions**: `FORMAT()`, `DATETRUNC()`, `MONTH()`

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation Objectives

- **Clean Null or Inconsistent Fields**:
  - Fill missing `product_name` based on `price`
  - Fill missing `price` based on known `product_name`
- **Recalculate and Fix Invalid Values**:
  - Recalculate `quantity` or `price` using `total_spent` when missing or zero
  - Recompute `total_spent` as `quantity * price`
- **Standardize Missing Text or Dates**:
  - Replace NULL in `payment_method`, `order_type`, and `transaction_date` with default placeholders
- **Validate Input**:
  - Insert only complete and logically correct rows into `orders_cafe`

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The script covers:

- **Basic Metrics**: Total, average, highest, and lowest sales  
- **Sales Breakdown**: By product, payment method, and order type  
- **Top Performers**: Highest revenue and quantity  
- **Temporal Trends**: Daily, weekday/weekend, and monthly patterns  
- **Comparative Insights**: Sales compared to benchmarks  
- **Sales Buckets**: Categorizing performance into low, medium, and high  
- **Ranking Analysis**: Product performance across order types and payment methods  
- **Cumulative and Moving Average**: Monthly cumulative trends and moving averages  
- **Stored Procedures**: Custom procedures to retrieve summary data for specific products
